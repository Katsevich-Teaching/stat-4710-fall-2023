<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Homework and Programming</h2>

<details>
  <summary> 
  May I use my own computer rather than Posit Cloud for programming?
  </summary>
  <p>Yes, you may use your own computer. In fact, if you want to try out GitHub Copilot (see <a href="https://katsevich-teaching.github.io/stat-4710-fall-2023/resources/ai/">instructor statement on AI</a>), then you will <em>need</em> to use your own computer. However, you will be responsible for installing R and RStudio on your computer, as well as installing all of the R packages necessary to complete the homework. Due to limited teaching staff bandwidth, we will not be able to assist you with this process. However, Google and ChatGPT are great resources.</p>

  <summary> 
  I installed RStudio but do not see an option to activate GitHub Copilot.
  </summary>
  <p>You probably installed the <a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/">released version of RStudio</a>. To get GitHub Copilot, you need to install the <a href="https://dailies.rstudio.com/">latest development version of RStudio</a>.</p>

  My code is giving me an error message. What should I do?
  </summary>
  <p>Read the error message carefully. Sometimes, the message will suggest a solution. If not, try Googling the error message. If this does not help, try asking ChatGPT. If you still need help, either post on <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/44045/discussion/">Ed Discussion</a> or come to office hours.</p>

<h2>Quizzes and Exams</h2>

<details>
  <summary> 
  What is the best way to prepare for quizzes?
  </summary>
  <p>The best way to prepare for quizzes is to work through the quiz practice questions and last year's quizzes, all available from the <a href="https://katsevich-teaching.github.io/stat-4710-fall-2023/index.html">main course webpage</a> or <a href="https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1741618">Canvas</a>. Furthermore, students should have a strong conceptual understanding of all material from lectures. Students are encouraged to come to office hours to verify and solidify their understanding of the material.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> 
  How many questions will be on each quiz?
  </summary>
  <p>Quizzes will typically have ten questions each.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> 
  What is the best way to prepare for exams?
  </summary>
  <p>The best way to prepare for exams is the same as the best way to prepare for quizzes.</p>

  How many questions will be on each exam?
  </summary>
  <p>This is not decided yet, but there will likely be in the range of 20-30 questions per exam.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  May I have a practice exam and/or previous years' exams?
  </summary>
  <p>This is the first year that exams have this format, so there are no exams from previous years. Due to the limited time of the teaching staff, we are unable to write a practice exam for you. However, the exam questions will be of a similar style to quiz questions, so going through the quiz practice questions and the quiz questions from this year and last will be a good way to prepare for exams.</p>
